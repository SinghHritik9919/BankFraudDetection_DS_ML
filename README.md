# BankFraudDetection_DS_ML
This project develops machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions in a bank dataset. Using techniques like Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, and XGBoost, the goal is to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. XGBoost achieved the best performance with 100% recall for fraud detection.
